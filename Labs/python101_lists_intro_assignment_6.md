## 📝 Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Set Up CodingBat Account (5 minutes)

1. Go to [https://codingbat.com](https://codingbat.com)
2. Navigate to **Python → List-1**
3. You should see all 12 problems listed

### Step 2: Solve Each Problem (Main Work)

For **EACH** of the 12 problems:

1. **Read the problem carefully** - Understand what it's asking
2. **Write your solution** in the CodingBat editor
3. **Click "Go"** to run the tests
4. **Fix any errors** until all tests turn **GREEN ✅**
5. **Take a screenshot** showing:
   - The problem name at the top
   - Your code solution
   - **All tests showing GREEN checkmarks** ✅
6. **Copy your code** to save it for your Colab notebook

**💡 Tip:** Don't move to the next problem until ALL tests are green!

### Step 3: Create Your Google Colab Notebook

1. Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com)
2. Create a new notebook
3. Name it: `YourName_Assignment6_Lists_CodingBat.ipynb`
4. Create the following structure:

```markdown
# Python 101 - Assignment 6: CodingBat Lists Practice
**Student Name:** Your Name Here
**Date:** Date Here

---

## Problem 1: first_last6

[Paste your code here]

---

## Problem 2: same_first_last

[Paste your code here]

---

[Continue for all 12 problems...]
```

5. For each problem:
   - Add a markdown cell with the problem name
   - Add a code cell with your solution
   - Add a markdown cell explaining what the code does (1-2 sentences)

### Step 4: Create Your Screenshot Document

**Option A: Word Document**
1. Open Microsoft Word
2. Title: "Python 101 - Assignment 6 - CodingBat Results"
3. Add your name and date at the top
4. Insert all 12 screenshots (one per page or stacked neatly)
5. Label each screenshot with the problem name
6. Save as: `YourName_Assignment6_Screenshots.docx`

**Option B: PowerPoint**
1. Open PowerPoint
2. Create a title slide with assignment info
3. Add one screenshot per slide
4. Label each slide with the problem name
5. Save as: `YourName_Assignment6_Screenshots.pptx`

### Step 5: Submit to Google Classroom

Submit **TWO files**:
1. ✅ Your Google Colab notebook (`.ipynb` file)
2. ✅ Your screenshots document (`.docx` or `.pptx` file)

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Both files must be submitted to receive full credit!

## 💡 Tips for Success

### General Tips:
- **Start early!** Don't wait until the last minute
- **Do one problem at a time** - Don't try to rush through all 12
- **Test thoroughly** - Make sure ALL tests pass before taking a screenshot
- **Ask for help** if you're stuck on a problem for more than 20 minutes
- **Use the hints** - CodingBat problems often have hints you can view

### Coding Tips:
- Remember **list indexing** starts at 0: `list[0]` is the first element
- Use `len(list)` to get the length of a list
- Use `list[-1]` to access the last element
- Practice the list methods we learned: `.append()`, `.insert()`, `.remove()`, etc.
- Read the problem requirements carefully - pay attention to edge cases!

### Common Mistakes to Avoid:
❌ Submitting code that doesn't pass all tests  
❌ Forgetting to take screenshots  
❌ Screenshots that don't show the tests passing (must be GREEN!)  
❌ Submitting only one file instead of both  
❌ Not labeling your screenshots  
❌ Messy or unorganized Colab notebook
