    "- **Pocket 0 is green.**\n",
    "- **For pockets 1 through 10**, the odd-numbered pockets are red and the even-numbered pockets are black.\n",

    "- **For pockets 19 through 28**, the odd-numbered pockets are red and the even-numbered pockets are black.\n",

    "**Requirements:**\n",
    "- The program should display an error message if the user enters a number that is outside the range of 0 through 36.\n",
    "- You must implement the `get_pocket_color(pocket)` function as specified below.\n",
