        "\n",
        "In this lab, you'll explore how Python handles variables in different **scopes**. Understanding scope is super important because it helps you avoid bugs and write cleaner code!\n",
        "\n",
        "### The 5 Scoping Rules:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **LOCAL Variables** - Variables created inside a function stay inside that function\n",
        "2. **GLOBAL Variables** - Variables created outside functions can be accessed anywhere\n",
        "3. **SHADOWING** - If you create a variable with the same name as a global variable inside a function, it becomes a new local variable\n",
        "4. **Modifying GLOBAL** - Use the `global` keyword when you want to change a global variable inside a function\n",
        "5. **Immutable = COPY** - When you pass numbers, strings, or booleans to a function, Python makes a copy (changes inside don't affect the original)\n",
        "\n",
        "### Quick Example:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "score = 100  # Global variable\n",
        "\n",
        "def game_over():\n",
        "    score = 0  # This is a NEW local variable (shadowing!)\n",
        "    print(f\"Inside function: {score}\")  # Prints 0\n",
        "\n",
        "game_over()\n",
        "print(f\"Outside function: {score}\")  # Still prints 100!\n",
