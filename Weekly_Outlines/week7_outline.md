# Python 101: Week 7 Outline

## üìö Module Topic: Iterations (Loops & Repetitions)

This week marks the beginning of our two-week deep dive into iterations in Python. Iterations allow us to execute code repeatedly, making our programs more efficient and powerful.

---

## üéØ Week 7 Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:
- Understand why repetition is essential in programming
- Generate random numbers using Python's random module
- Implement while loops for indefinite iteration
- Control loop execution using `break` and `continue` statements
- Use sentinel values to control loop termination

---

## üìñ Topics Covered This Week

### 0. Why Do We Need Repetition?
- Understanding the concept of iteration
- Real-world applications of loops
- Advantages of using loops vs. repetitive code

### 1. Generating Random Numbers
- Introduction to the `random` module
- Using `random.randint()`, `random.random()`, and other functions
- Applications in simulations and games

### 2. While Loops (Indefinite Loops)
- Syntax and structure of while loops
- Loop condition and termination
- Common use cases for while loops
- Avoiding infinite loops

### 3. While Loop with `break`
- Using `break` to exit a loop early
- Practical examples of break statements
- When to use `break` vs. natural termination

### 4. While Loop with `continue`
- Using `continue` to skip iterations
- Difference between `break` and `continue`
- Practical applications of `continue`

### 5. While Loop with Sentinel
- Understanding sentinel values
- Implementing sentinel-controlled loops
- Common sentinel patterns (e.g., -1, empty string, "quit")

---

## üîÆ Coming Next Week (Week 8 Preview)

We will continue our exploration of iterations with:
- `range()` function
- For loops (counting/definite loops)
- Nested loops
- Extending while loops with `else`
- Extending for loops with `else`

## üí° Study Tips

1. **Practice, practice, practice!** Loops are fundamental to programming. The more you code, the more intuitive they become.

2. **Trace your loops** - Write down what happens in each iteration to understand the flow.

3. **Watch for infinite loops** - Always ensure your while loop condition will eventually become false.

4. **Test edge cases** - What happens when your loop runs zero times? Once? Many times?

5. **Use the debugger** - Step through your code to see exactly what's happening in each iteration.

## ü§î Key Questions to Consider

- When should I use a while loop instead of other control structures?
- How can I prevent infinite loops in my code?
- What's the difference between `break` and `continue`, and when should I use each?
- How do sentinel values make user input more flexible?

---

## üìù Additional Practice

If you finish the lab early and want more practice:
- Try creating a number guessing game using a while loop
- Write a program that validates user input using a while loop with `continue`
- Create a menu-driven program using a sentinel-controlled while loop

**Remember:** Loops are one of the most powerful tools in programming. Master them this week, and you'll be well-prepared for more complex programming challenges ahead!
