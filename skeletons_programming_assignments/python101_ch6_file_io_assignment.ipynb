    "You will create a program that generates a personalized HTML web page based on user input. The program will:\n",
    "1. Ask the user for their name\n",
    "2. Ask the user for a sentence describing themselves\n",
    "3. Create an HTML file with the user's information\n",
    "4. Include proper exception handling for file operations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives:\n",
    "- Practice file I/O operations (writing to files)\n",
    "- Work with string formatting and HTML content\n",
    "- Implement exception handling for file operations\n",
    "- Create a practical, real-world application\n",
